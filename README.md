#EmployeeTracker

====ABOUT====
The user story behind this application is as follows: "As a business owner I want to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company, so that I can organize and plan my business." The user is able to add, delete, view, and even update a MySQL server using the command line. The information is saved after each action, and the questions continue until the user selects "Exit".

====TECHNOLOGIES====
I used Node.js and MySQL to create this application. I used the NPM packages mysql, inquirer, and cTable. Originally I tried to make my file more modular, but I ran into some problems. I ended up putting everything in a single file. In the future, I would like to make the code rely on classes, but again, I didn't have much time to work on this.
